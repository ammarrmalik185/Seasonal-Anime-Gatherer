personality.
 
Upon seeing mixed opinions on her profile after their first date, and still tormented by his previous relationship, Kazuya believes that Chizuru 
is just playing around with the hearts of men and leaves her a negative rating. Angry at her client's disrespect towards her, Chizuru reveals her true 
nature: sassy and temperamental, the complete opposite of Kazuya's first impression. At that very moment, Kazuya receives news of his grandmother's collapse 
and is forced to bring Chizuru along with him to the hospital.
 
Although it turns out to be nothing serious, his grandmother is ecstatic that Kazuya 
has finally found a serious girlfriend, which had always been her wish. Unable to tell her the truth, Kazuya and Chizuru are forced into a fake 
relationship—acting as if they are truly lovers.
